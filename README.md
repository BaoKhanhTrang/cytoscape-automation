# cytoscape-automation

Cytoscape is a desktop-based tool that focuses on user-initiated operations generating user-consumable results. Cytoscape Automation enables users to create workflows executed entirely within Cytoscape or by external tools (e.g., Jupyter, R, GenomeSpace, etc), and whose results are reproducible. This enables Cytoscape to scale to large collections of datasets and to larger more complex workflows than is practical via keyboard and mouse.

Cytoscape Automation exists in two skins â€“ the Commands interface and the REST interface. Both can accomplish similar results, but are focused on different usage styles. Commands reprise user-initiated interactions (e.g., open session, import data, export image), whereas the REST interface enables programmers to manipulate and operate on networks as internal Cytoscape data. Commands are also available via the REST interface.
